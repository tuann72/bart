 * reverts the instant the drag leaves the handle. The fix is a class on <body>
 * for the duration, which is why this hook owns the class lifecycle — every
 * exit path has to clear it (pointer up, pointer cancel, and unmounting
 * mid-drag), or the whole page is left stuck with a resize cursor.
 *
 * `onStart` runs at pointer-down so callers can snapshot the geometry they are
 * about to resize; `onDelta` receives movement relative to that starting point.
