 * keeps the panel mounted until its exit animation reports done. Because
 * intent and animation are separate, reopening while the exit plays (e.g. the
 * selection popover's "Ask Bart" mid-close) simply cancels the exit instead of
 * losing the request — the render-time reset below runs before anything
 * unmounts. An external `open={false}` from the controlling component skips
 * the animation and unmounts immediately, as controlled components do.
 *
 * With `prefers-reduced-motion`, `closing` is never entered: the panel
 * unmounts on the same commit that flips `open`, so nothing ever waits on an
 * `animationend` that will not fire.
